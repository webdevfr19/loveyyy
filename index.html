        <p class="letter-header">Dear Castrid,</p>
        <p class="letter-content"> 
            Never thought that us, meeting in that specific app, in a perfect timing, will be the happiest day of my life. I am still baffled on how perfect it is, to the point where I thought that someone is writing a love story—and we are the main characters in it, destined to meet and be in love ‘till death. 
            3 months in 2025 and yet, you made me feel like I am 5 years ahead with my imaginations with you—having a family, in our dream home in Tagaytay. You made me realize that there is so much in love that I do not know, and I am happy that it is you that will be fulfilling it. Thank you for all the memories and the future memories we will be making. I will surely treasure it until the time where I can make it as a story for our children when we eat in our pretty dining area. I never knew that a love like this exists, thank you for making me feel this way. Thank you for giving me a chance, although it is super rushed 😭🙏. Thank you for believing in me na hindi kita nila-lovebomb😭 and kung ano man yung mga bagay na ginawa nila sayo before, you never thought of it about me—heck we booked an airbnb super early because you trust me so much—and i love it. It will be a funny story in our wedding and to our future children on how pasaway and goofy we are when meeting. There is so much to say love, you know me as a human being na hindi yapper and cannot write but here i am writing to you, the things we do for love is surprising to me sometimes. You going here sa Manila, without even overthinking about it. I love you, i love you so much! You are my baby forever! Thank you also for listening to me, i will listen to you whenever i feel off okay? I do not want us to fight, we communicate! Happy 2nd loveyy dayy my Castrid! I am here whenever you need me, i am one call away! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!! HAPPY 2ND LOVEYY DAY!!
